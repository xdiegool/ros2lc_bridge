INTRODUCTION
    This is a bridge that enables exporting and importing topics to/from a ROS
    system. The bridge sits inside the ROS system. Thus, traffic going towards
    other nodes in the ROS system is referred to traffic on the "inside" of
    the bridge, while traffic going towards other nodes outside the ROS system
    is referred to as traffic on the "outside" of the bridge.

                       |         ROS          |
                       |                   +--------+
                       |               <== |        | <====
                       |               IN  | BRIDGE |  OUT
                       |               ==> |        | =====>
                       |                   +--------+
                       |                      |
                       +----------------------+

    Traffic on the outside is currently sent via LabComm over TCP (although
    there are plans to extend this to other transport layers in the future).
    Communication on the inside is performed with ROSComm over TCP.

    Currently, the bridge is written in Python but plans exists to migrate the
    code base to C/C++.

RUNNING BRIDGE
    The bridge can be run as:

        $ rosrun generator generator.py -c path/to/config/file.xml

    It can also be run with the --help parameter to display info about other
    parameters.

RUNNING ROS/LC PINGPONG
    First start the ROS node:

        $ rosrun ros_pingpong pingpong.py

    Then run and start the generated bridge (say it was generated with the
    name test_bridge):

        $ rosrun test_bridge main.py

    Lastly, start the lc_pingpong node and everything should work:

        $ ./src/pingpong.py
