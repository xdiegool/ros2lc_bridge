# TODO for C++

## TOP PRIO
    * Get services to work. Currently missing:
        - ?
    * Change calls to convert_type() to use keyword arguments.
    * Get static connections to work.
    * Merge C++ generator with Python.

## LATER
    * Perhaps keep a pool of service threads per client to avoid spawning new
      ones every time a service call comes in?
    * Get Lua to work?


# Other
1. Generator queries master for all avail. topics and generates pkg.
   This include creating equivalent labcomm types.
   Use static config file to some extent.

2. Request comes in over lc. conf. channel and requests a topic.

   Req. format:
   Query: topic name

3. If no ros::subscriber exists, then create one.
   Otherwise $(reuse or create another one anyway?).
