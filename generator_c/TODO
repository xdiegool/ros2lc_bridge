# TODO for C++

## TOP PRIO
    * Get services to work. Currently missing:
        - Don't send topic data if client just requests a service.
    * Currently, the conversion can't handle void types (i.e. dummy types) as
      parameters (or return values).
    * If you connect and only subscribe to one topic but the bridge is
      configured with more topics, it will send all of them (not just the one
      you requested). Same thing happens when trying to request just a service
      from the bridge. Known bug.

## LATER
    * Get static connections to work.
    * Perhaps keep a pool of service threads per client to avoid spawning new
      ones every time a service call comes in?
    * Get Lua to work?


# Other
1. Generator queries master for all avail. topics and generates pkg.
   This include creating equivalent labcomm types.
   Use static config file to some extent.

2. Request comes in over lc. conf. channel and requests a topic.

   Req. format:
   Query: topic name

3. If no ros::subscriber exists, then create one.
   Otherwise $(reuse or create another one anyway?).
